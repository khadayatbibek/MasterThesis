## Text Quality in Search-Supported Writing Tasks

This thesis investigates automatic measures for the identification of
text quality patterns. Text quality in terms of organization, cohesion,
coherence, readability, or vocabulary typically varies throughout
a text, and automatically finding lower-quality paragraphs can help
streamline the workflows of editors.

In this work, we compare a selection of established text coherence
measures from the computational linguistics literature, and apply them
to a dataset of 150 long essays with detailed revision history.
Particular to these essays is the fact that they were written with the
support of a search engine, which helped the authors identify
material they could reuse in their texts. This allows us to investigate
not only how text quality develops across the paragraphs of the finished
text, but also over time as the text is written.
